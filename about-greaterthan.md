# About Greaterthan

## How your organize changes everything.&#x20;

****[**Greaterthan**](http://greaterthan.works)**'**s purpose is to develop and grow the impact of new ways of organizing, and to be in service of the individuals and organizations who are driving this work forward. We are a home for aligned practitioners to experiment, support others on their transformation journeys and develop products that make these practices accessible to wider audiences.&#x20;

### **We want to help usher in a new era, where our organizing structures and cultures contribute to a more healthy system for all.**

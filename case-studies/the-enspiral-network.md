[Enspiral](http://enspiral.com/) is a network of entrepreneurs and freelancers whose mission is to help more people work on stuff that matters. Since 2013, we have been practising collaborative funding to allocate collective funds through a participatory process. As the network’s needs and realities have changed over the years, this practice we call ‘cobudgeting’, has evolved alongside it.

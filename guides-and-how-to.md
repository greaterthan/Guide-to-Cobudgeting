#### 1. How do I format my bucket beautifully?

Buckets use **Markdown formatting,** a simple type of formatting that works through html. It might sound a little scary, but it's very easy to use! 

[ &gt;&gt; See how to use markdown](https://www.loomio.org/markdown)

#### 2. What information should I include in my bucket?

When creating a bucket, you are free to add anything you like in the description! To make your bucket as clear and convincing as possible, here are some suggestions on what you could include:

* **Context:** why this idea? 
* **Breakdown of costs:** show what people's funds will go to in more detail
* **Who **is going to do the work? \(If not just you\)
* **Timeline:** what deadlines and milestones are there for the project?

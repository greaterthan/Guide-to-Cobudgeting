# Why Collaborative Funding?

## Money makes Collaboration Real

To cope and thrive in today's rapidly changing environment, many organizations want to become more collaborative and human-centered. Our years of experience working in distributed networks has shown us that one of the **hardest aspects** of collaboration **relates to money and resource management.** It is also **a powerful starting point** for creating engagement and participation.

We believe that **opening up decisions around resource allocation and money help make collaboration real** and driven towards tangible actions. Our experience of implementing collaborative funding practices in networks such as Enspiral have shown that it can be a powerful tool to increase engagement, transparency and agility in organisations, networks, communities and groups.

## Why organizations do collaborative funding

The reasons for doing collaborative funding are manifold, but here are some common objectives:&#x20;

* To run participatory internal innovation programs and call-for-proposals
* To Catalyze employee or member engagement by enabling them to propose projects and allocate resources to them
* To create more participation and transparency in their financial and budgeting processes.

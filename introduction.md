# Welcome to Greaterthan's Guide to Collaborative Finance

This Handbook provides you with everything you need to make collaborative finance easy with the help of training resources, guides, and stories.

## Why collaborative finance?

We believe that **opening up decisions around resource allocation and money help make collaboration real** and driven towards tangible actions. Our experience of implementing collaborative finance practices in networks such as Enspiral have shown that it can be a powerful tool to increase engagement, transparency and agility in organisations, networks, communities and groups.

## Learning from each other

If you would like to share and learn from experiences with others implementing Collaborative Finance in their organizations, request an invite to our **[Community of Practice](https://www.loomio.org/g/CI3j26MK/greaterthan-community).**

# The stages of cobudgeting: key resources & templates

A cobudget process tends to go through 5 basic stages: discovery, setup, running & closing the process and reporting. Here is a brief introduction to each of these phases and key resources & templates to help you take your group through these steps of cobudgeting.

## ![](/assets/phasescobudget.png)1. Discovery

In this phase we recommend you hold a workshop with your organisation to analyze how cobudgeting can provide value for you and identify where \(in which team or process\) you can integrate your first cobudget round.

Since this first step is often the most challenging, you may want human support with this first step. If that is the case, the Greaterthan team would be happy to hold a [**customized workshop for you to kick you off with Cobudget**](https://greater.finance/services/).

## 2. Setup

Now that you have identifed where you want to get started with using Cobudget in your organisation, it's time to **setup the detailed parameters of your Cobudget group**. By this we mean how Cobudget will be integrated into your exsiting way of working and agreeing on the basic rules for how you will use it, such as who can join the group, how funds will be distributed etc.

## 3. Run

## 4. Close & Report

Once your round is over, you need to ensure that everything that took place inside the tool is handed over cleanly to an administration for processing and making payments. To measure your success with using Cobudget, it's useful to track metrics about your group and its engagement.
